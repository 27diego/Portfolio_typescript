              The reason I choose to dedicate myself to this is because I enjoy
              web development and I enjoy creating. I look at a blank screen
              like as if it is a drawing board where I can come up with
              something and make it turn to life. It gives me that same artistic
              feeling of playing the guitar. It is something that I can say I
              love to do.

              I come from a family of hard workers and self made individuals. My
              parents went from working in the Salinas valley fields and going
              to school at the same time, while raising two children, to
              becoming a nurse and a management technician respectively. It is
              from them that I get my belief that hard work and determination
              can accomplish everything and anything. This belief is what
              allowed me to go through college while being a full time worker
              and expand my knowledge of what I enjoy doing even outside of
              school, taking online courses and applying my learning when I
              could.

              When I'm not coding

                <p className='description__body'>
                  When I'm not coding or designing potential projects, I can be
                  found either learning new songs on my guitar or lifting
                  weights. Playing the guitar is another way I can open my mind
                  to new creative ideas not only on how to play a certain melody
                  but also on how to come up with new designs and new ways to
                  tackle developing problems. As for lifting I enjoy being
                  active and trying to stay healthy so it is something that I
                  like to challenge myself with. Lifting gave me a stronger
                  sense of if I can put my mind to it, I can achieve it.
