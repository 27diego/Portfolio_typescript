            The reason I choose to dedicate myself to this is because I enjoy
            web development and I enjoy creating. I look at a blank screen like
            as if it is a drawing board where I can come up with something and
            make it turn to life. It gives me that same artistic feeling of
            playing the guitar. It is something that I can say I love to do

            I come from a family of hard workers and self made individuals. My
            parents went from working in the Salinas valley fields and going to
            school at the same time, while raising two children, to becoming a
            nurse and a management technician respectively. It is from them that
            I get my belief that hard work and determination can accomplish
            everything and anything. This belief is what allowed me to go
            through college while being a full time worker and expand my
            knowledge of what I enjoy doing even outside of school, taking
            online courses and applying my learning when I could.

                When I'm not coding or designing potential projects, I can be
                found either learning new songs on my guitar or lifting weights.
                Playing the guitar is another way I can open my mind to new
                creative ideas not only on how to play a certain melody but also
                on how to come up with new designs and new ways to tackle
                developing problems. As for lifting I enjoy being active and
                trying to stay healthy so it is something that I like to
                challenge myself with. Lifting gave me a stronger sense of if I
                can put my mind to it, I can achieve it and it worked! In my
                first 10-12 months of lifting I gained 20lbs of muscle!
